# Kalamari
Kalamari **will** be an open-source alternative android client for [Bakalari](https://bakalari.cz/), but it's in the **early stages** of development and I don't have **much time** to work on it, so the first working version is not in sight.
## Up ahead
Planned features are:
- **Faster** and better-looking UI and web communication
- Working **offline mode**
- Faster and more convenient predictor (**Even if your school doesn't allow you to use it!**)
- More **customizable** options (e.g. timetable change notifications)
- Option to save the login credentials, so they won't be needed in future
- Overall better app **stability**
## Final acknowledgements
Special thanks to all contributors of the unofficial [Bakalari API description](https://github.com/bakalari-api/bakalari-api-v3), without whom this project would not have been possible.
